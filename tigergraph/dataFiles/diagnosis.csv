0,Hypertension,"High blood pressure (hypertension) is a common condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems such as heart disease.
Blood pressure is determined both by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries the higher your blood pressure. A blood pressure reading is given in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). It has two numbers.
Top number (systolic pressure). The first or upper number measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats.
Bottom number (diastolic pressure). The second or lower number measures the pressure in your arteries between beats.
You can have high blood pressure for years without any symptoms. Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases your risk of serious health problems including heart attack and stroke.",Most people with high blood pressure have no signs or symptoms even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. A few people with high blood pressure may have headaches shortness of breath or nosebleeds but these signs and symptoms arent specific and usually dont occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage.,0|
