0,lisinopril,"Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor. ACE stands for angiotensin converting enzyme. They block the production of angiotensin II a substance that narrows blood vessels and releases hormones such as aldosterone and norepinephrine by inhibiting an enzyme called angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin II aldosterone and norepinephrine all increase blood pressure and urine production by the kidneys. If levels of these three substances decrease in the body this allows blood vessels to relax and dilate (widen) reducing both blood and kidney pressure. ACE inhibitors also increase the production of bradykinin another substance that makes blood vessels dilate.
